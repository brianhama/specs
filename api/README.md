## The openstorage driver API

The openstorage API is documented here http://api.openstorage.org/

If your driver supports these interfaces, it will work in an openstorage compatible multi node Linux container deployment.

Openstorage offers a default implementation that supports Docker as the container engine and Swarm as the distributed scheduler.
