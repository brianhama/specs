# Lib Open Storage Specifications

This project is about defining an interface to orchestrate the provisioning of storage volumes for Linux containers and creating a specification by which a volume's properties can be defined.  It also provides a UX specification defining how an end user would provision storage for stateful applications deployed in Linux containers.

We hope that this work will align with the Open Containers Project.

We also encourage anyone that has a vested interest in supporting stateful Linux containers to join this effort. 

# The Six Factors of Storage for Linux Containers

This specification defines the following six factors of provisioning storage to Linux Containers:
1. A software spec that can be included as part of the Container spec.  This spec defines the properties of the storage volume, such as a specific class of service and snapshot requirements.  It also allows for an initial format of the volume with the required filesystem and it's properties.

2. A RESTful API for orchestrating the provisioning of a volume, such that it can be driven by the container orchestration software.

3. An interface for binding a volume into a container's namespace.

4. An interface for container granular storage operations.  These include Snapshots, Class of Service (CoS) and Clones.

5. An interface for extracting metrics and logs from the storage provider on a per-volume basis.

6. The User Experience (UX) for for an end user can interact with Open Storage.
